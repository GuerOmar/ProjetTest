# Software Testing Project

This project was realised by Omar GUERMAZI and Hedi GASSARA.

In this project we did a specification document for the Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) in wich we did describe the plan,
the coding standards then the high level requirements and low level requirements for the system.


The code above is the implementation of the first high level requirement and the unit test for the TCAS class.
